PYTHOB-10dni

These are assignments that I undertake after watching tutorials from edX and Code with Harry tutorials on Introduction to Python. Doing so have greatly helped me in self-evaluating my skills and understanding.

1- 01dni: 

   Python code for a calculator that does 4 arithematic operations on the basis of user's input and choice. This goes on as a loop until the user inputs the command to exit by choosing option 6.

2- 02dni:

   Python code for verifing if the email is Google mail ID and is legit. For a mail to be legit it has to follow some conditions like it shouldn't have space in between, front or at back; it shouldn't 
   have "." at end or at begining of username in an email (username@gmail.com); length of username should be between 6-30; if username has 8 charecters then at least one should be an alphabet. If any of 
   these aren't true, then It will display "Not a legit ID" and the reason. Above this if the domain itself is not "gmail.com" then it displays "Not a Gmail ID. Maybe from some other Domain" and prints the 
   domain given as  this is to verify the Google mail ID.
