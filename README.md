PYTHOB-10dni

These are assignments that I undertake after watching tutorials from edX and Code with Harry tutorials on Introduction to Python. Doing so have greatly helped me in self-evaluating my skills and understanding.

1- 01dni: 

Python code for a calculator that does 4 arithematic operations on the basis of user's input and choice. This goes on as a loop until the user inputs the command to exit by choosing option 6.

2- 02dni:

Python code for verifing if the email is Google mail ID and is legit. For a mail to be legit it has to follow some conditions like it shouldn't have space in between, front or at back; it shouldn't 
have "." at end or at begining of username in an email (username@gmail.com); length of username should be between 6-30; if username has 8 charecters then at least one should be an alphabet. If any of 
these aren't true, then It will display "Not a legit ID" and the reason. Above this if the domain itself is not "gmail.com" then it displays "Not a Gmail ID. Maybe from some other Domain" and prints the 
domain given as  this is to verify the Google mail ID.

3- 03dni:

Simple temperature converter program in Python that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Make use of mathematical formulas and  similar code that of calculater in 01dni.

4- 04dni:

Simple program that prints the number of times the string 'bob' occurs in str. For example, if str= 'azcbobobegghakl' then it shows 'bob' occurred 1 time. It make use of function count.

5- 05dni:

Consist of two ways first, doesn't use user confirmation to give directions. This uses an input checks if its with range ([0,100]-low=0, high=100) if not it prints 'Out of range'. If within the range then 
checks if its below or above the median of the range if found high it changes variable low=((low+high)//2)-1 else high=((low+high)//2)+1 and if its equal to the guessed number i.e.((low+high)//2) then 
print the number.

Second asks for user input if guess is the answer (key is 's'), or if if guess is higher than guess (key is 'h'), or if guess is less than guess (key is 'l') and rest, does other functions similar to first 
case.
